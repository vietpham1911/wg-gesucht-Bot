# WG-Gesucht Bot (Incomplete Due to CAPTCHA)

## Overview
I developed a Python and Selenium bot to automate messaging new WG-Gesucht listings. The goal was to automate my search process to find an apartment.

## Status
The project was not completed due to WG-Gesucht's reCAPTCHA system, which prevented full automation. Despite this, the project was a valuable experience in browser automation and handling dynamic content.

## Key Features
- **Selenium Automation**: Automates interaction with WG-Gesucht.
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Chrome starts in fullscreen.
- **Automatic Interaction**: Clicks listings and attempts to send messages.
- **Page Reloading**: Reloads every 5 minutes to find new listings.

## Challenges
- **reCAPTCHA**: Prevented full automation.
- **Dynamic Content**: Managed using Seleniumâ€™s explicit waits.
